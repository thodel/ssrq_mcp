embeddings.py — the embedding layer shared by the pipeline and the server.

The MCP server is where an institution's embeddings live: a client asks a
question in natural language and the server answers with the passages that mean
the same thing, rather than the ones that happen to share keywords.

For the Swiss Law Sources that gap is wide. The corpus is 1050-1846: German,
French and Latin legal prose in diplomatic transcription, spelled as the
scribe spelled it. A user asking "how were widows provided for?" in modern
German shares almost no surface forms with "wie froͧwen naͧch unnser statt
reͣcht ußgericht weͣrden soͤllen". Keyword search reaches this material only
if you already know the orthography.

Vectors come from GPUStack (`qwen3-embedding-0.6b`, 1024 dimensions), are
L2-normalised on the way in, and are stored as float32 BLOBs in SQLite. The
corpus is 4,624 documents, so similarity is a brute-force dot product over a
numpy array — no index, nothing to tune, exact results.

Mirrors kf_mcp/embeddings.py; the corpus-specific part is the transcription
cleanup below.

# The edition transcribes diplomatically. Segment boundaries are marked with ✳
# (82,062 of them), and every abbreviated word is written as the raw manuscript
# form immediately followed by the editor's expansion:
#
#     "un̄ und"           the raw form is a whole word            -> und
#     "Hein r₎ rich"      the raw form continues a fragment       -> Heinrich
#     "stif tˀin terin"                                           -> stifterin
